I no longer use this, so this is now archived, slightly more modern then the Original from Banh

## Descriptions

Dockerized FMD2 (Windows with Wine) using VNC, noVNC and webSocketify to display GUI on a webpage.

Websites protected with Cloudflare do not work with this, FlareSolverr doesnt work with wine.

Make sure to configure it using the 'web' ui.

## Features:
* Does not require any display, works headless
* Keeps all of FMD2 features
* Since it's docker, it works on Linux
* Make use of Linuxserver ubuntu image
